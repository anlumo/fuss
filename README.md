Fuss - Small, lightweight simplex noise generator for Rust.

This library only provides functionality for generating 2D and 3D simplex noise, as well as the ability to normalize the noise through sum octaves (fractal Brownian motion).

[View the Docs](https://docs.rs/fuss/0.2.2/fuss/)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Add fuss to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
# Get the current stable
fuss = "0.2.2"
```

### Examples

All fuss interactions happen through the `Simplex` struct. 

Here's how you get one:

```rust
extern crate fuss;
use fuss::Simplex;

let sn = Simplex::new();
```

`Simplex` lets you generate 2D and 3D noise.

```rust
let sn = Simplex::new();
sn.noise_2d(1.0, -1.0);
sn.noise_3d(1.0, -1.0, 0.0);
```

Which lets you generate noise for large sets of points:

```rust
let sn = Simplex::new();

let mut map = Vec::<Vec<Vec<f32>>>::new();
for x in 0..10 {
  map.push(Vec::<Vec<f32>>::new());
  for y in 0..10 {
    map[x as usize].push(Vec::<f32>::new());
    for z in 0..10 {
      map[x as usize][y as usize].push(sn.noise_3d(x as f32, y as f32, z as f32));
    }
  }
}
```

`Simplex` generates it's own permutation table based on the rust RNG, however you can apply your own seed to get a `Simplex` as such:

```rust
let sn = Simplex::from_seed(vec![0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
let other_sn = Simplex::from_seed(vec![0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);

// The two simplexes will generate the same noise for the same points
// if given the same RNG seed
assert_eq!(sn.noise_2d(0.0, 0.0), other_sn.noise_2d(0.0, 0.0));
```

`Simplex` uses the same type of seeds that `SeedableRng` does, being a slice of `usize`s, however to make this easier `Simplex` will accept a `Vec<usize>` instead.

### Running the tests

Run

```bash
$ cargo test
```

to run all unit tests and doc tests.

## Versioning

fuss follows cargo's rules of Semantic Versioning:

  - Before we reach 1.0.0, anything goes, but if we make breaking changes, we increment the minor version. In Rust, breaking changes include adding fields to structs or variants to enums.
  - After 1.0.0, we only make breaking changes when we increment the major version.
  - After 1.0.0, we donâ€™t add any new public API (no new pub anything) in tiny versions. We always increment the minor version if you add any new pub structs, traits, fields, types, functions, methods or anything else.
  - We use version numbers with three numeric parts such as 1.0.0 rather than 1.0.
